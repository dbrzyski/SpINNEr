Code for simulations in 

A Sparsity Inducing Nuclear-Norm Estimator (SpINNEr) for Matrix-Variate Regression in Brain Connectivity Analysis.

Source code needed:  

/spinnerCode 			
/SimulationFunctions

Matlab package needed: glmnet_matlab

Steps:
1. Run S1_simulated_n150ones.m to get results for simulation setting 1.
2. Run S2_simulated_varyn.m to get results for simulation setting 2.
3. Run S3_realAA_ones.m to get results for simulation setting 3.
4. Run SaveResults.R to prepare results for plot.
5. Run plots_for_simulations.R to obtain the figures in the paper.
